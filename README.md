# navigation-thru-sms

If you're lost somewhere without great service, or are in another country where SMS is cheaper than roaming charges for accessing the Internet, text 'yo' to 917-540-7972 to access Google Maps directions over SMS -- requiring only a 2G connection. 

Uses Twilio, Flask, and the Google Maps API to receive user queries and respond with directions.
